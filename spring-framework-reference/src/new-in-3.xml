    <title>Improved documentation</title>

    <para>The Spring reference documentation has also substantially been
    updated to reflect all of the changes and new features for Spring 3.0. 
    While every effort has been made to ensure that there are no errors in this
    documentation, some errors may nevertheless have crept in. If you do spot
    any typos or even more serious errors, and you can spare a few cycles
    during lunch, please do bring the error to the attention of the Spring
    team by <ulink
